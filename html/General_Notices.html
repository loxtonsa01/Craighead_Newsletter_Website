            I didn't know what PTO in the corner of a piece of paper meant until recently. It still keeps me up at night

        <h3>CHAPEL</h3>
        <p>As we continue into Lent, we begin the week by exploring fasting. Has there ever been a time in your life
            that
            you have fasted from something? Why did you fast? During Lent we often fast from an item, or a practice so
            that
            we can draw closer to God.</p>

        <p>Towards the end of the week, we wonder what is meditation? Meditation through a Biblical lens is about
            filling our minds with God's words. Of reading a daily Psalm or engaging in a Bible App. Phillipians 4:8
            puts it:
            "Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable."</p>

        <p>DaVine Youth Group 6:30-8:30pm every Wednesday.</p>
