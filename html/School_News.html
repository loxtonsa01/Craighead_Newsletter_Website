        <p><b>Year 11 History Trip</b></p>

        <p>Last week, Year 11 History students travelled to Arrowtown to gather resources for our History internals. On
            Wednesday, we went to Bendigo Goldfields and were provided with useful background information on the life of
            early miners and the dangers they faced. We visited the Goldfields Mining Centre, in the Kawarau Gorge. We
            all tried our hands at gold panning, although unfortunately nobody “struck it big”. Thursday was a busy and
            focused day for us, with access granted to the Lakes District Museum archives and a historical tour around
            Arrowtown, including the cemetery. Friday was spent visiting the Cromwell and Alexandra cemeteries and the
            Cromwell museum, to help with our internals. All the girls thoroughly enjoyed the trip and are grateful for
            the opportunities to explore Central Otago history. We would like to say a huge thanks to Mr Gibbs and Ms
            Reeves for driving the vans and putting up with us for three whole days, to the Dining Room staff for
            catering for us and to all the staff at Lakes District Museum, Goldfields Mining Centre and Cromwell Museum.
            Also, a massive thank you to Mrs Johnston for all the time and effort that went into organising this trip,
            as well as making sure it was enjoyable and informative.</p>

        <p><b>Year 12 Geography field trip to Aoraki Mt Cook:</b></p>
        <p>“Do something new, New Zealand” is something that we have heard a lot over the past 12 months since our
            borders have been closed due to Covid-19. Last week, the Year 12 Geography students were lucky enough to put
            this catch phrase into practise and get out and explore the beautiful Aoraki Mt Cook whilst of course
            working on internal, and external assessments. Over the two days, we conducted research on the vegetation in
            different areas of the National Park, saw the incredible Tasman Glacier from the Tasman Lake and put
            together smaller pictures of information we had learnt in class for everything to come together and make
            sense. We also had sessions with DOC to learn more about glaciation and their perspective on the
            controversial 1080. The Glacier Explorers boat trip to the glacier was definitely a highlight and although
            the weather was definitely not what we had hoped for, we all managed to have an amazing time and explore a
            new part of our country. We would love to say a massive thank you to Miss Gilbert and Miss Smillie for
            organising and facilitating the trip. Without your efforts, this trip wouldn’t have been possible.

        <p><b>Y12 Bio trip</b></p>
        <p>Students from the Year 12 Biology classes gathering data on glacial moraines of the Mueller Glacier, at
            Aoraki/Mt Cook, last Wednesday. Weather conditions tested the students’ ability to record plant species in
            the field, with Alpine weather really demonstrating how volatile it could be. The students were recording
            data for the internal assessment on Identifying a Community Pattern they will be completing in the coming
            week.</p>

        <p><b>Year 9 German</b></p>
        <p>In the Year 9 German class, we have been learning about how the Fasching festival is celebrated around
            Germany and combining this with learning the colours so we can describe our colourful Faschingsmaske! Do you
            recognise the faces behind the masks?</p>
